# TicTacToerminal
A simple terminal tic-tac-toe game for two players with a user-defined grid size.

Build the game using any C++ compiler and run. 

The users are first prompted for a grid size and then entries are made turn by turn in a _(Ycoord, Xcoord)_ format until the game ends in a victory or a draw.
